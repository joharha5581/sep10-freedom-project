## Part B: possible future technology
* AI-Powered Story Companion
  * Unlike current software that mainly handles fomatting and collaboration, this software tool would actively help writers with story development, character arcs, dialogue creation, and pacing. Writers could input their initial  ideas and AI would gnerate scene suggestions, dialogue options or possabily plot twists with cliff-hangers which make a story more intresting. This maintains narratives logic and genre conventions.
