##### How I Brainstormed Part B

For Part B of my project, I focused on developing my invention idea: FilmMind, an all-in-one screenwriting and filmmaking application. I started ny listing the biggest problems screenwriters face, like having to use many different apps to stay organized. Then I brainstormed how FilmMind could solve all those problems in one place. I imagined what tools would help writrers the most, such as a script organizer, filming location suggestions, casting ideas, and even music reccomendations that match the genre or culture of the story. 

After that, I sketched out how the app would look and how each feature would connect togther. I wrote down the steps a screenwriter would follow: upload a script > receive suggestions > get a shooting plan > organize scenes. This helped me think how FilmMind would actually work in real life. 


##### How I Finailized My Content 

Once my brainstorming was done, I organized all all my ideas into a clear section for my website. I wrote the final descriptions of the app, and made sure everything was easy to read and understand. I went back to my rough notes and cleaned up the writing so it looked professional and ready for publishing. I also made sure the content connected smoothly- starting with the problem, then the solution, then how FilmMind makes screenwriting easier. By finalizing everything, I'm now ready to upload it to my website as part of my Freedom Project.


##### Sources 

Even though most of my ideas came from brainstorming and my own experience with screenwriting, I still looked at other tools to undertsna dwhat features are common. I researched script-organizing apps, film-planning websites, and screenwiritng programs. These gave me ideas on what writers struggle with and what my app can improve. 


##### EDP (Engineering Design Process)

The steps I used in the Engineering Design Process were: 
1) Identify the problem: Writers use too many apps and waste time finializing the scripts and staying organized.
2) Research: Looked at existing tools to see what features they offer.
3) Imagine: Brainstormed FilmMind and how it could combine all the filmmaking tools in one place.
4) Plan: Designed the main features and the steps the user would take.
5) Create: Finalized the written content and organized my ideas for the website
6) Improve: Went back to edit my explanations so they were clear and more profeesional.


##### Skills

During this part of the project, I practiced organizing large ideas, explaining technology in a simple way, and planning how my invention solves real problems. I improved my brainstorming skills and learned how to design ann app content step-by-step. I also stregthened my writing skills by making my content ready for a website. 


##### Professionalism

I made sure my writing was, clear, formal, and appropriate for grammer and made sure the structure was easy to follow,. I stayed focused, worked responsibly, and kept myt work organized so that it looks professional when I upload it.
