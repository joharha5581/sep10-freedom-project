*** How I Brainstormed Part B

For Part B of my project, I focused on developing my invention idea: FilmMind, an all-in-one screenwriting and filmmaking application. I started ny listing the biggest problems screenwriters face, like having to use many different apps to stay organized. Then I brainstormed how FilmMind could solve all those problems in one place. I imagined what tools would help writrers the most, such as a script organizer, filming location suggestions, casting ideas, and even music reccomendations that match the genre or culture of the story. 

After that, I sketched out how the app would look and how each feature would connect togther. I wrote down the steps a screenwriter would follow: upload a script > receive suggestions > get a shooting plan > organize scenes. This helped me think how FilmMind would actually work in real life.
