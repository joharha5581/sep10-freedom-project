##### Content:
Since my first blog, I explored more tools that can help screenwriters.
For hardware, I found the Ophaya 3-in-1 Digital Pen Set and the Livescribe Echo 2 Smartpen. Both pens can turn handwriting into digital notes, which helps writers keep story ideas organized.
For software, I found Mirror Image Script Q Advanced Software and Script Studio for Windows. Script Q helps writers read and control teleprompters easily, while Script Studio helps plan and format screenplays in a simple way.

##### How I found it:
I searched on Google using phrases like “best smart pens for writers 2025,” “Mirror Image Script Q features,” and “Script Studio screenwriting software.”
Websites like TechRadar, CNET, MirrorImageTeleprompters.com, and ScriptStudio.com helped me learn more. I also watched short YouTube reviews to see how the tools work.

##### EDP Stage:
Right now, I am in the research stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). I’m collecting information and exploring possible solutions for screenwriters. This stage helps me plan the next stage, which is to develop ideas and test which tools work best for my project.
Skills:
I improved my research and summarizing skills by using better keywords and rewriting long information in my own words.

##### Professionalism:
I used clear writing, correct spelling, and reliable sources so my work looks organized and easy to understand.
