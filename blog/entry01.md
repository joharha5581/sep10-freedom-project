What’s My Topic (Screenwriter)
	

## My Topic

The topic I chose for this project is screen-writing and the reason why is because I’ve been very curious about how the shows that I’ve watched are so well written and detailed. But the biggest reason is that I wanted to make the scenarios I’ve had in my head to be put on screens so I can watch what I’ve always dreamed of in a tv-show. I’ve always wanted for my work to be something I enjoy doing and not for any other reasons. I’ve been writing a script for the past seven months, a script that can be performed by actors and put on screens. I can say that I’ve gotten experience in writing especially when it comes to connecting the “dots” as well as making plot twists, having a climax and most importantly ending each episode for example with a cliff-hanger. Technology is/can be a big and significant supporter of screen-writing. Here are some sources I’ve got to learn more from about screen-writing. 

## Process

The point I’m in right now is trying to contact producers and many different directors but also I'm working on how to use the best websites to organize my script so when I hand in my work it can look even more good. And so I’ve found that exact website called Final Draft. Now when I hand in my script it can be easily read and I get accepted. 

## Skills
What I've got out of this is learning how to connect plot twists to each other and leave the scenes with cliff-hangers, which is the most important process to do when writing a script like mine. I’ve learned how to keep everything connected and make sense with everything else. 

## Next Step
I’m planning to reach out to more people and use as many applications and websites as possible to make my script well written and organized.
